# Fireclaw configuration file

# -- SERVER LIST --
# 'add server' creates a list of servers. the syntax is:
# "add server hostname:port password"
#
# Port and password are optional, examples:
#
# "add server irc.secretserver.org:5406 fur28dp"
# "add server irc.netgamers.org"
# "add server qnps.tx.us.netgamers.org:8080"
#
# If no port is specified, DEFAULT_PORT is used (6667).
#

add server trustnet.de.eu.netgamers.org:6667
add server london.uk.eu.netgamers.org
add server irc.netgamers.org

# These dictate how many connection attempts before giving up, and how 
# long to wait (seconds)  between connects. For infinite tries, use 0 for 
# connect.attempts.

# Now for the obvious:
# NOTE: 'vhost' should always be an IP.

set nick TheClaw
set ident fireclaw
set realname http://www.fireclaw.org

# Relaychan, you can set this to a channel or a nick, or to 0 if you want 
# to disable it completly. Regardless of this setting, all relay messages 
# goto the DCC line anyway - which is lag/flood free (much better method).

set relaychan 0


# -- SERVICES CONFIG --
# These variables are for setting up an interface with network services.
# Prefix is what messages will be sent to.
# E.g for 'Auth'. The bot will send the equivilent of:
# "/msg <servicePrefix> <serviceAuth>"
# And so no for Ghost and Op. Ghost is for recovering our nick if it
# gets taken/ghosted. Op is for requesting op in "%s".

set servicePrefix P@cservice.netgamers.org
set serviceAuth login user pass
set serviceGhost recover

# NOTE:
# DO NOT MISS OUT THE %s (channel name), or the bot will crash.

# DCC Chat settings.
#
# allowguests - means that non-admins will be able to enter a dcc chat 
# with the bot and view/talk on the partyline - but nothing else.
#
# isolate - isolate partyline from the rest of the botnet?
#
# timeout - this is how long a dcc session can be idle until it is closed 
# down. I don't recommend setting this too high.
#
# listenport - if you want reverse dcc's and telnet access to work, set 
# this to an available, accessable port that fireclaw can use.

# Link settings (botnet)
#
# link.name - a unique identifier of this bot. It's what the bot will be 
# known as on the botnet.
#
# link.port - set this to something other than 0 if you want the bot to 
# listen on a port for incoming botnet connections.

set link.name TheClaw
set link.port 6613

# Links
# Syntax: add link <botname> <password> <targetip:port> <flags>
# Flags:
# l = leaf, not allowed to have other connections.
# t = trusted, give this bot op and invite when it needs it.
# d = dependant, master bot - this bot wont enforce any rules or flags 
#     if there are any opped linked 'd' bots.

# Float settings, these affect how the dynamic +l setting works.
#
# float.period is the smallest possible time in seconds between setting 
# +l and float.thresh is a measure of how close the user count must be to 
# the limit before reseting the limit higher.

set float.period 3

# Flood settings, these affect flag 'f', channel and user flood 
# protection.
#
# Basically, flood detection is triggered if we recieve more than 'limit' 
# lines in 'period' seconds. This done on per-user and per-chan basis.

# Per user:
set flood.period 7
set flood.limit 7

# Per chan:
set flood.global.period 20

# We can set different nickflood limits to take effect when/if a channel 
# is set +m, you can set these here, or just set them the same or to 0 if 
# you dont want different limits. This is designed to combat nick talking.

#
# repeat.limit sets how many repeats are allowed before a kick.

# trigger the ban ?

# limit is how many seconds an op must be idle for us to deop.
# if givevoice is set, it will voice aswell as deoping. 1 = on, 0 = off

set idle.limit 7200

# If we get a message from a non-admin in PM, should we relay it to the

# cleanbanlist - This will be active is set to anything greater than 0
# Basically if it is set, then *NO* bans will be allowed to stay in the
# channel banlist for more than <x> hours. This includes any bans set by
# other ops. Bans are not removed from our internal list however, so
# offenders will be rebanned if they join again.

set cleanbanlist 0


# nooverride - Most servers send some limits/settings on connect, such
# as max number of modes we can do in one line, and banlist limits.
# These are specified manually earlier in the config, but will be 
# overriden by the values the server tells us. If you do not want this to 
# happen, set this to 1.

# Punishment messages and lengths, customize as you please:
# Max len for any message is 127 chars.
# The lengths are in seconds. These are not the actual banlengths. What 
# happens is each user has "long term karma", this increments the more 
# offences they trigger, and decreases slowly over time.
# Therefore the actual ban length is calculated by the length below 
# multiplyed by long term karma. For a guide, the *first* time they get 
# banned it will be either 3 * thislength or 4 * thislength.
# The second time they get banned it could be 7, 8 or 9 * thislength.
