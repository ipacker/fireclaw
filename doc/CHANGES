Fireclaw 0.93 (16/07/03)
----------------------
  o [NEW] Bots can get invite and ops from each other with use of the 
          'trusted flag' (t) on the botnet. Also added flag 'l' to force a 
          link to be a leaf. Other general botnet improvments.
  o [NEW] Botnet flag: 'd' for allowing multiple bots to take over each over if 
          the master dies.

Fireclaw 0.92 (25/06/03)
----------------------
  o [FIX] Segfault on socket death under certain circumstances - how on 
          earth did this last this long?!
  o [NEW] Botnet now tracks what bots are linked and what users are 
          connected. This is reflected in the commands: .who and .linktree
          Also added .connect <mask>.

Fireclaw 0.91 (24/06/03)
-----------------------
  o [NEW] boot command for removing unwanted dcc users.
  o [NEW] Reverse DCC, so you can enter a dcc chat session with the bot
          even if you are behind a firewall. (/msg bot dccme)
          ** This is ADMINS ONLY (doesn't work for guests) **
          Also using the same code, you can telnet the bot to get access.
  o [FIX] Increased 'broken server?' limit. This seems to happen a bit too
          often for my liking...
  o [FIX] strncpy() replaced with mystrncpy(), fixing a number of 
          potentional bugs waiting to happen.
  o [FIX] Old random word list and vhost list weren't cleared when config 
          was rehashed resulting in duplicate entries and all sorts of 
          crap.
  o [NEW] Basic botnet. Just shared partyline for now - I don't really 
          suggest you use it yet.
  o [FIX] Timeskew detection improved a bit, it now wipes all flood + 
          repeat settings - otherwise the bot can end up going haywire.

Fireclaw 0.9
-----------------------
  o [NEW] Sockets rewriten from scratch.
  o [FIX] CPU usage fixed by about 75% (!!)
  o [NEW] DCC Chat - partyline and admin commands. Guest users are also 
          able to connect (to chat only). This is all configurable in the 
          config.
  o [NEW] On-join detector. Fireclaw can connect a second client every X
          X minutes - from a random IP, nick, realname, ident. This is 
          flag 'd', and it will detect onjoin msgs and ban the offenders.
  o [FIX] unban command now reports hardban and softban removals seperatly 
          (less confusing)
  o [FIX] Time skews shouldn't screw up the bot now. (timers are completly 
          reset if it is detected that system time has been changed 
          backwards, or excessively forwards). I am not confident this is 
          good solution, it may need revising in the future.

  o [FIX] Crash when encountering a blank entry in exclude.txt.
  o [NEW] SIGHUP now causes config reload.
